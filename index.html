    <h2>Comparison of Functionality</h2>
    <p>In the following tables, I compare the functionality of the three dropdowns using keyboard, mouse, and touch interaction. I pay special attention to the relative strengths and weaknesses of each when it comes to accessibility.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tables-container">
    <div class="table-wrapper">
      <h2>Table 1</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Amazon</th>
          <th>Google</th>
          <th>Discord</th>
          <th>Similarities</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mouse</td>
          <td>- Clicking and dragging highlights text inside the dropdown menu</td>
          <td>- Clicking once on the remove option button removes the option from the dropdown; clicking and dragging off does nothing</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>
            - Opens automatically on typing in the search box; typing changes results of the dropdown instantaneously<br>
            - Users select options by hovering over them with cursor<br>
            - Right click/double click does nothing unique to the dropdown<br>
            - Clicking once on an option takes the user to results for that term<br>
            - Clicking and dragging does nothing but select the option visually unless the user drags back onto the initially selected option<br>
            <br>
            - The simplicity of all three interfaces makes them memorable and easy to learn. The function reveals itself as the user types into the search bar; the responsive results are an affordance in themselves. <br>
            
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Keyboard</td>
          <td>- escape exits the searchbar entirely but retains the search term<br>
            - tabbing while in the dropdown exits the dropdown and search bar, refocusing on another element<br>
            - pressing space while on an option fills in the searchbar with that option, repopulating the dropdown accordingly<br>
            <br>
            - Escape exiting the dropdown entirely feels natural and is easily memorable, since that is most often its function in UI. <br>
            </td>
          <td>- tab navigates down (shift + tab navigates up), alternating between selecting an option and the button to remove that option<br>
            - one escape resets hover to the top of the list, second exits the dropdown but keeps focus on searchbar<br>
            - enter on remove button it removes the option<br>
            - pressing space while on an option fills in the searchbar with that option, repopulating the dropdown accordingly<br>
            <br>
            - The tab-to-traverse option in combination with the need to press escape twice to exit the dropdown could be frustrating and unintuitive for some users. The mixing and matching of functionality between different buttons makes the interface slightly less accessible, since it aligns poorly with common patterns.<br>
            </td>
          <td>- escape exits and resets the search bar<br>
            - tabbing while in the dropdown exits the dropdown and search bar, refocusing on another element<br>
            <br>
            - Escape exiting the dropdown entirely feels natural and is easily memorable, since that is most often its function in UI. However, the fact that it also resets the search term itself is unintuitive and could be frustrating.<br>
            </td>
          <td>- Opens automatically on typing in the search box; typing changes results of the dropdown instantaneously<br>
            - Use arrow keys to navigate up and down; holding down the arrow key speeds up the traversal<br>
            - Enter takes user to the results of the hovered option<br>
            <br>
            - The arrow-key traversal is efficient and intuitive; the top-to-bottom layout makes the up/down traversal feel natural. The flow of type -> select -> enter is natural and easy to learn/remember. It fits in with common UI paradigms (enter key enters, up/down arrows navigate). <br>
            <br>
            - The three components are roughly equivalent in accessibility for keyboard users. They are easy to access using tab to select the search bar, and once the user does so, they are quite simple to navigate using tab and/or arrow keys. <br>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Touch</td>
          <td>- Menu only opens when user starts typing into the search bar, updates as they type<br>
            - Pressing on an option brings up results<br>
            <br>
            - The dropdown is very simple and clear. Since there is only one way to interact with it, it is very learnable and memorable. <br>
            <br>
            - The dropdown is accessible. It has good color contrast and the options are large enough that even someone with poor dexterity could select them accurately.<br>
            </td>
          <td>- Menu opens automatically when a user clicks on the search bar, updates as they type<br>
            - Pressing on an option brings up results<br>
            - Button on the right fills search bar with term from option<br>
            <br>
            - The dropdown is simple and clear in its utility. Search icons (spyglass affordance) on the left make it clear that you can tap on an option to search it.<br>
            <br>
            - The black-on-white color contrast makes the options easy to distinguish even on a small screen. The options could be slightly larger to accommodate people with poor dexterity. 
            </td>
          <td>- Press on separate button to bring up search filters/options dropdown; press anywhere else to close it; background is darkened while menu is open<br>
            - Pressing on an option fills search in with the chosen filter; user must then type further or select another option to see results<br>
            - Dragging finger across dropdown creates haptic buzz<br>
            <br>
            - The hiddenness of the menu and the disparate nature of some of the options (so you have to go to multiple places besides the menu itself to piece together a workable result) makes it somewhat unintuitive and hard to learn. The options themselves are clear in what they do.<br>
            <br>
            - The button to open the menu has very low contrast with the background, so some users might have trouble seeing it if they didn’t know it was there. The darkening background around the menu helps accessibility by reducing visual clutter on the small screen.<br>

          <td>Their functionality is simple, intuitive, and memorable overall. There is minimal use of affordances, though the layout and content of the dropdowns makes it naturally clear what their purpose is. 

            The menus have good color contrast and visual layout.

            <p>My revised state diagram for keyboard interaction. I have tweaked the way escape works slightly so that most of the time it will simply close the dropdown outright. This improves learnability, since it aligns more closely with typical escape functionality, but it could also make the interface less efficient for keyboard users who often switch between options in the menu, since it eliminates a method of traversing to the top.</p>

            <p>My revised state diagram for mouse interaction makes use of right click for different functionality. While in the original implementation, right and left click both took the user to the page corresponding to the suggestion, right click now removes the suggestion instead. This makes a tradeoff between efficiency and learnability, since it might be confusing for some users who right click only to find their option gone.</p>

    <h2>Takeaways/Questions</h2>
    <p>
      Google and Amazon did well with the simplicity of their designs and bold color palettes, which made their menus easily learnable and fairly accessible visually. I've tried to maintain the overall look and palette of the menu, while making some slight visual tweaks for more clarity. I took inspiration from Discord's effective use of instructive symbols in my choice of button icon for the preview. I chose to make it always visible as a clear indicator of the functionality, as opposed to the existing designs, which only show the buttons on hovering a suggestion.<br>
      <br>
      My revised component solves for a couple mismatches. One is with users who use a screenreader, or even just the keyboard, to navigate, for whom it is especially inefficient to be constantly switching pages entirely. It would also help people who aren't adept at formulating google searches to quickly find the terms that best align with their intentions, rather than sending them down a rabbit hole. <br>
      <br>
      On the mobile Discord application, the button to open the search filters menu was offset from the search bar did not contrast very well with the surroundings. On the one hand, people with visual impairments might have a hard time locating the button, especially if they don't already know about it. On the other, the automatic appearance of the dropdown below the search bars on Amazon and Google could lead to visual clutter and confusion (especially because they use the same palettes as the search bar) for someone with poor eyesight, or even someone who's simply in a hurry.<br>
      <br>
      Google's focus order had some extra steps, for example needing to press escape twice to exit the dropdown (once moved back to the top option). While this could allow for more flexibility for frequent keyboard users, I could see the departure from some norms, ie. of escape exiting a component, being confusing, especially for someone using a screen reader. <br>
      <br>
      It seems like interfaces are mostly designed for mouse/trackpad users and mobile users. The mobile interfaces were quite different to the desktop ones, which suggests to me that they may be worked on by separate teams. When it came to keyboard vs. mouse, however, the visual language of the components lent themselves better to mouse interaction than keyboard. On discord, for example, I could see a keyboard/screen-reader user being very confused by the options presented to them through the focus order. </p>
