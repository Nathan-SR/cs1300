      <h2>What Are Personas?</h2>
      <div class="section-description">While designing user interfaces, it is important to consider a range of potential users. A feature integral to one user's experience might not even factor into another user's interaction with the interface. Personas allow designers to represent archetypical users of their interface in a format that makes it easy to imagine how they might interact with them.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="headline">
      <h2>Choosing an Interface</h2>
      <div class="section-description">I chose to assess a CVS self-checkout kiosk. Self-checkout kiosks are fairly ubiquitous and include a diverse array of physical and digital interfaces. Below is an annotated sketch of the kiosk.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="image-panel">

          <div class="observation-container-large">
          Kiosks
are positioned at the front of the store and are easily visible and accessible.
The kiosk is comprised of a digital screen that provides 
directions on using the interface, and allows users to indicate
payment method, apply rewards, etc. Under the screen is a scanner
for items. To the right, a card reader allows users to pay. To the bottom
right of the interface, a small platform stocked with paper or plastic
bags allows users to package their items as they scan them. 
          </div>

  <div class="headline">
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <div class="section-description">The first step towards creating useful and accurate personas is observing real users and gathering information about how they interact with the interface. I asked questions to get a sense of how real users interacted with the kiosk.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content-sidescroll">
    <div class="question-container">
      <div class="question-title">Question 1 (Before Interaction)</div>
      <div class="question">What is the most important thing this kiosk can do to serve you well right now?</div>
      <div class="summary">All three users indicated that ease and efficiency of use was the most important to them.
        The user with the specific goal of using a coupon especially valued ease of use.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
      <div class="question-title">Question 2 (Before Interaction)</div>
          <div class="question">
              Are you very familiar, somewhat familiar, or not very familiar with this kind of kiosk?
          </div>
          <div class="summary">
              One user had limited experience with the kiosk; one reported using self checkout systems in general, just not at CVS; the final user was somewhat familiar.
          </div>
      </div>
    <div class="question-container">
      <div class="question-title">Question 3</div>
          <div class="question">
              Did this kiosk do a good job meeting your needs from question 1?
          </div>
          <div class="summary">
              The user who hoped to scan a coupon appreciated how the kiosk visually and verbally instructed them throughout the process, though they did feel somewhat overwhelmed by the number of options presented to them onscreen.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Another user found the audio cues from the kiosk loud and distracting. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The third user accidentally put their items into the scanning area before scanning them, causing the kiosk to request help from staff. They were frustrated and felt like it would have been easier just to have someone else ring them up. They were embarrassed to hold others up.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, the experience was mixed. The kiosks have many interactive elements, which might help some users feel well taken care of, while others are overwhelmed or annoyed.

    <div class="question-container">
      <div class="question-title">Question 4</div>
          <div class="question">
              Did anything about your experience using this kiosk surprise you?
          </div>
          <div class="summary">
              The users were mostly focused on their task and reported that the interface was similar to kiosks they had used in different stores, or were otherwise unremarkable. One user commented that they liked the musical jingle played after paying. 
          </div>
      </div>
    <div class="question-container">
      <div class="question-title">Question 5</div>
          <div class="question">
              What was your favorite/least favorite part of using this kiosk?
          </div>
          <div class="summary">
              Two users appreciated the efficiency of the self checkout, commenting that it takes less time than being rung up by a person. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One user noted that it felt like a lot was going on while they checked out, between scanning, paying, bagging, waiting for a receipt, and being directed by the kiosk’s voice and text prompts. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The user with the bagging area troubles was frustrated and felt like self checkout made things more complicated for everyone. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Users didn’t seem to have very strong feelings about their experiences unless something went wrong, in which case the impersonality of the kiosk and the quantity of inputs and outputs exacerbated their frustration. 
          </div>

    <div class="question-container">
      <div class="question-title">Question 6</div>
          <div class="question">
              If you could make one change to this kiosk, what would it be?
          </div>
          <div class="summary">
              The user who was somewhat familiar with the kiosk felt it met their needs adequately.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One user mentioned cutting down on the number of noises made by the kiosks, or making them quieter.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One user wished there was a more obvious place to put down their items before scanning.

          The users mostly had fairly brief interactions with the self checkout kiosks. They all had only a few items, and for the most part were able to quickly scan and pay for them. 
          </div>
          <div class="observation-container">
          Users mostly followed a similar process: scan items and put them in the bagging area one at a time, pay, bag their items, and leave. Other actions, such as using coupons, were worked into this flow. 
          </div>
          <div class="observation-container">
          Whenever users hesitated, there was usually an audio cue or text prompt from the kiosk instructing them on what to do next, which helped prevent them from getting stuck for more than a few seconds.

      <h2>The Personas</h2>
      <div class="section-description">Using my observations of real users, I constructed two personas, which serve as archetypal representations of qualities from the users I observed. Steve and Carrie are amalgamations of characteristics of my three real users.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="image-panel gap">

          <div class="img-desc">
          Steve is a university student who has come down with the
flu. He is stressed and disoriented, and wants to avoid human contact. 
<br/>
<br/>
Steve’s mind is foggy, and he is easily overwhelmed by loud
noises and an abundance of visual/audio cues. He doesn’t want to
talk to anyone, so the auto request help feature stresses him out. 
He is fatigued and wants to set his items down, so the stringent but 
unwritten rules about placing items in the bagging area frustrates him.
<br/>
<br/>
Steve represents a user with little patience for inconveniences, who
is sensitive to things not going smoothly/how he expects. He wants
to be done as quickly and easily as possible. His sickness exacerbates
these qualities, but many users might feel similarly to him. Self-checkout
kiosks are meant to facilitate efficiency, so it should meet his needs.

          Carrie is a recent graduate who is always looking for ways to save
money. Her roommate gave her a coupon for soap from CVS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Carrie is a naive user off the CVS self-checkout kiosk. She is motivated
to figure it out, but her unfamiliarity and the thought of wasting money
makes her anxious. She is overwhelmed by the number of options presented to her
at certain junctions, and relies on visual and audio cues to guide her through
the process. She likes that the kiosk presents her with multiple
opportunities to call for help. 
<br/>
<br/>
Carrie represents a user who is unfamiliar with the interface and has a specific
use-case in mind. She is the user who needs the interface to tell her exactly
what to do, whether explicitly or through affordances and design. Self-checkout
kiosks are meant to be intuitive for a wide array of users, so it should meet her needs.
