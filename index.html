      <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
      <div class="section-description">What makes a website well-designed? While it can depend on what the website is designed for, a few central tenets of good design usually hold true: it should be adaptable to many screen sizes, responsive in its interactivity, and accessible to people who might use it in many different contexts. <br/><br/>These qualities nearly universally make the experience of using a website better. For example, picking higher contrast colors to help colorblind users benefits everyone, including those who are also vision impaired; responsive buttons that light up or change size when hovered make sites more intuitive and satisfying for everyone, while especially helping people who are vision impaired. The benefits of flexibility and accessibility are deep and far-reaching. </div>

      <h2>Choosing a Website</h2>
      <div class="section-description">I was assigned to find a website I thought could do better in fulfilling the three tenets I outlined above: adaptability, responsiveness, and accessibility. I thought a good place to start was the website of a local restaurant near me: East Side Pockets in Providence, Rhode Island. <br/><br/> Their website isn't terrible by any means; it serves its purpose and communicates the important information. However, I knew that with some improvements to the three tenets, I could elevate the site from merely functional to easy and satisfying to use.</div>

          A view of the original website's Menu page. The page is chock full of information, but the layout makes some of it hard to find, while overemphasizing less important elements. Below, I'll identify a few key problem areas.

      <h2>Problem areas</h2>
      <div class="section-description">In order to identify the most pressing problem areas, I asked myself what the purpose of the Menu page was, and what was getting in its way. The purpose is twofold: to provide a respository of information about the food they serve, and to allow customers to make online orders through the interface.</div>

        <div class="problem-description">
            <h3>Problem 1: Unecessary Components</h3>
            The large banner below the top menu persisted from the home page to the menu page, where is is unecessary. In a page already cluttered with many different colors, icons, and images, it obscures the important content on the page, making it less efficient, less intuitive, and less accessible for people using keyboard navigation, who may think they went to the wrong page.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The top menu also has far too many items, many of which users most likely rarely click on, and could be condensed into a sub-menu.

      </div>
      <div class="problem-description">
          <h3>Problem 2: Lack of Visual Consistency</h3>
          As exemplified by the buttons at the top of menu, each element on the page has its own unique color and layout. Thus, the visual language of the site is little help in navigating it. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Additionally, these buttons, nor the top menu, stick to the top of the page, meaning they're lost when the user scrolls down. This makes the functionality less efficient, less memorable, and less accessible.

      </div>
      <div class="problem-description">
          <h3>Problem 3: Dull and Obscure Presentation</h3>
          As shown in this image, the main content of the menu itself--the menu items--are presented mostly as blocks of text with minimal visual and spacial organization. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Those items with images are so tiny as to be almost invisible, which might make it hard for users ordering online to assess them, and is certainly detrimental to visually impaired users. The icons next to the title lack explanation; users might wonder what a thumbs up means. There is also no obvious place to click to order the items. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          While the menu items convey information about the food, they don't do so in a manner conducive to a pleasant online ordering experience.

      <h2>My Redesign</h2>

          <h3>Streamlining the Interface</h3>
          My first peoject was cleaning up the visual clutter of the old page. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          To this end, I cleaned up the top menu, removed the busy banner below it, and pared down the number of buttons everywhere. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The result is a page that delivers what it needs to to fulfill its purpose, without unecessary distractions and confusing diversions.

        <h3>Refreshing the Menu</h3>
        My second task was to make the menu more pleasant to interact with and more straightforwardly informative for online shoppers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        By making the image the centerpiece of each item, I help online shoppers while adding visual consistency and appeal. I also improved the icons to stand out visually, and added a button to clarify the user flow for adding items. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The result is a page that's simply nicer to look at, while also being more informative and easier to navigate.

    <div class="problem-description">
        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
        The original page was responded to differing screen sizes by condensing the content into a smaller space. I wanted a more tailored approach.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At smaller screen sizes, columns and images collapse to better fit the page while keeping the general layout consistent. On phone screens, the cart tab is replaced by the cart icon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The result is a page that feels like it was designed for each screen resolution, rather than growing cluttered on smaller screens.
