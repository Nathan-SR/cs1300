      <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
      <div class="section-description">What makes a website well-designed? While it can depend on what the website is designed for, a few central tenets of good design usually hold true: it should be adaptable to many screen sizes, responsive in its interactivity, and accessible to people who might use it in many different contexts. <br/><br/>These qualities nearly universally make the experience of using a website better. For example, picking higher contrast colors to help colorblind users benefits everyone, including those who are also vision impaired; responsive buttons that light up or change size when hovered make sites more intuitive and satisfying for everyone, while especially helping people who are vision impaired. The benefits of flexibility and accessibility are deep and far-reaching. </div>

      <h2>Choosing a Website</h2>
      <div class="section-description">I was assigned to find a website I thought could do better in fulfilling the three tenets I outlined above: adaptability, responsiveness, and accessibility. I thought a good place to start was the website of a local restaurant near me: East Side Pockets in Providence, Rhode Island. <br/><br/> Their website isn't terrible by any means; it serves its purpose and communicates the important information. However, I knew that with some improvements to the three tenets, I could elevate the site from merely functional to easy and satisfying to use.</div>

          A view of the original website's Menu page. The page is chock full of information, but the layout makes some of it hard to find, while overemphasizing less important elements. Below, I'll identify a few key problem areas.

      <h2>Problem areas</h2>
      <div class="section-description">In order to identify the most pressing problem areas, I asked myself what the purpose of the Menu page was, and what was getting in its way. The purpose is twofold: to provide a respository of information about the food they serve, and to allow customers to make online orders through the interface.</div>

              The user who hoped to scan a coupon appreciated how the kiosk visually and verbally instructed them throughout the process, though they did feel somewhat overwhelmed by the number of options presented to them onscreen.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Another user found the audio cues from the kiosk loud and distracting. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The third user accidentally put their items into the scanning area before scanning them, causing the kiosk to request help from staff. They were frustrated and felt like it would have been easier just to have someone else ring them up. They were embarrassed to hold others up.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, the experience was mixed. The kiosks have many interactive elements, which might help some users feel well taken care of, while others are overwhelmed or annoyed.

              The users were mostly focused on their task and reported that the interface was similar to kiosks they had used in different stores, or were otherwise unremarkable. One user commented that they liked the musical jingle played after paying.

              <br/>
              <br/>
              One user noted that it felt like a lot was going on while they checked out, between scanning, paying, bagging, waiting for a receipt, and being directed by the kiosk’s voice and text prompts. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The user with the bagging area troubles was frustrated and felt like self checkout made things more complicated for everyone. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Users didn’t seem to have very strong feelings about their experiences unless something went wrong, in which case the impersonality of the kiosk and the quantity of inputs and outputs exacerbated their frustration.

              One user mentioned cutting down on the number of noises made by the kiosks, or making them quieter.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              One user wished there was a more obvious place to put down their items before scanning.

          The users mostly had fairly brief interactions with the self checkout kiosks. They all had only a few items, and for the most part were able to quickly scan and pay for them. 
          </div>
          <div class="observation-container">
          Users mostly followed a similar process: scan items and put them in the bagging area one at a time, pay, bag their items, and leave. Other actions, such as using coupons, were worked into this flow. 
          </div>
          <div class="observation-container">
          Whenever users hesitated, there was usually an audio cue or text prompt from the kiosk instructing them on what to do next, which helped prevent them from getting stuck for more than a few seconds.

      <h2>The Personas</h2>
      <div class="section-description">Using my observations of real users, I constructed two personas, which serve as archetypal representations of qualities from the users I observed. Steve and Carrie are amalgamations of characteristics of my three real users.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="image-panel gap">

          <div class="img-desc">
          Steve is a university student who has come down with the
flu. He is stressed and disoriented, and wants to avoid human contact. 
<br/>
<br/>
Steve’s mind is foggy, and he is easily overwhelmed by loud
noises and an abundance of visual/audio cues. He doesn’t want to
talk to anyone, so the auto request help feature stresses him out. 
He is fatigued and wants to set his items down, so the stringent but 
unwritten rules about placing items in the bagging area frustrates him.
<br/>
<br/>
Steve represents a user with little patience for inconveniences, who
is sensitive to things not going smoothly/how he expects. He wants
to be done as quickly and easily as possible. His sickness exacerbates
these qualities, but many users might feel similarly to him. Self-checkout
kiosks are meant to facilitate efficiency, so it should meet his needs.

          Carrie is a recent graduate who is always looking for ways to save
money. Her roommate gave her a coupon for soap from CVS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Carrie is a naive user off the CVS self-checkout kiosk. She is motivated
to figure it out, but her unfamiliarity and the thought of wasting money
makes her anxious. She is overwhelmed by the number of options presented to her
at certain junctions, and relies on visual and audio cues to guide her through
the process. She likes that the kiosk presents her with multiple
opportunities to call for help. 
<br/>
<br/>
Carrie represents a user who is unfamiliar with the interface and has a specific
use-case in mind. She is the user who needs the interface to tell her exactly
what to do, whether explicitly or through affordances and design. Self-checkout
kiosks are meant to be intuitive for a wide array of users, so it should meet her needs.
